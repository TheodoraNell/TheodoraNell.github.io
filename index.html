        <h3>Over the past century, human life expectancy has greatly increased due to advancements in science, technology, and cultural awareness of public health.
        But which factors have had the greatest impact? 
        We believe that answering this question could help to provide key insights for countless organizations all over the world that lead humanitarian efforts, government legislation, and infrastructure planning. </h3>

        <h3>The majority of the data used in this analysis comes from the World Health Organization.
        The datasets contain metrics on a wide variety of health-related and economic factors for over 200 countries during the years 2005-2015. 
        Our goal is to create a machine learning model to accurately predict life expectancy based on these metrics and determine which features have the highest importance. </h3>

    <h3> Current Life Expectancy Data 
    <br>
    From the World Health Organization's 2022 Comprehensive Report, May 20, 2022:</h3>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/20-05-2022-world-health-statistics-2022" class="link-secondary">The complete article can be read here </a> </h4>
    <h4>The World Health Organization has published its latest comprehensive set of World Health Statistics to 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to an estimated 4.5 million excess deaths in that year.
    <h4>The statistics reveal the extent to which the pandemic has been affecting health systems worldwide, in some cases severely curtailing access to vital services. These disruptions are likely to set back global progress on both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy made in the first 20 years of the century.
    <h4>Global life expectancy at birth had increased from 66.8 years in 2000 to 73.3 years in 2019, and healthy life expectancy increased from 58.3 years to 63.7 years. This was largely due to gains in maternal and child health, and to major investments and improvements in communicable disease programmes, such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. But the 2020 data shows how service disruptions contributed to an increase in deaths from tuberculosis and malaria between 2019 and 2020.
    <h4>Prior to the pandemic, there had also been encouraging trends globally in the reduction of child stunting, alcohol consumption and tobacco use, as well as in increased access to safely managed drinking water, safely managed sanitation, basic hygiene, and clean fuels and technologies for cooking.</h4>
